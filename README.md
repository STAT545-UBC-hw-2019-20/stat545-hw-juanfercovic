## Who am I?
My name is Juan Fercovic and I am from Chile. I've been living in Canada for 6 years. Originally I came to pursue my Masterâ€™s degree, but after I finished I stayed working as Academic Coordinator and Research Assistant and UBC. I also climbed a lot :wink:. Now, and I am in the second year of my PhD, in Environmental Economics. I fact, one of our class mates in my Thesis supervisor :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.

In general, my life can be placed in the following dimensions:

|*My wife and daughter* | *Climbing* | *Study* |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| My daughter is 2 and is my constant joy. | I live in Squamish (the mecca here) and commute to campus. | I love my research focused on energy consumption and carbon taxes. |
